# Face object tracking app

To run, open the folder as a project in android studio. Select the folder with the green Android icon on it when opening the project.
Select the "app" configuration from the configuration list and upload to your device. It may take several minutes to download dependencies when opening for the first time. If the build fails, make sure you have an updated version of android studio.
The app should open on your device and ask for permissions. Once permissions are granted you should see glasses rendered on your face in real time.

Our code is primarily in FaceMeshGraphic.java.
